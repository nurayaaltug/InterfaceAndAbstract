# InterfaceAndAbstract
We are developing a customer management system for a coffee shop that works with Starbucks and Nero. Both companies want to save their customers' information in a database. When registering customers, Starbucks requires MERSIS verification, but Nero doesn't. Starbucks also wants to reward customers with a star for every coffee purchase.
